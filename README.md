# Mathematical Machine Learning 

The repository contains material as lecture notes for a university course on "Mathematical Machine Learning". 

The focus of the course is on some mathematical topics in modern machine learning, such as the curse of dimensionality. The script is accompanied by a computational lab, i.e., a collections of programming notebooks that exemplify problems mentioned in the script. 

## Installation  
To use the computational lab make sure you have python, and jupyter notebook installed on your computer. To install all the required packages run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

## Using the lab.
