# Mathematical Machine Learning 

The repository contains material that was developed as lecture notes for the course "Mathematical Machine Learning" prepared for master students at Universit√§t Hamburg. 

The focus of the course is laid on some mathematical topics in modern machine learning, such as the curse of dimensionality. The script is accompanied by a computational lab, i.e., a collections of programming notebooks that exemplify problems mentioned in the script.
